# Azure Web App
A CRUD application for <b>Student management system</b> using a Thymeleaf on frontend and Java SpringBoot on backend.

This applications has the capabilities to view,insert,update,delete the student data.This application can be quite helpful in digitalization of student records in Edtech Industry.

The Application is deployed on Microsoft Azure using Azure services like Azure App service,Azure mysql for database,Azure Resource Mover,Application insights,Azure storage.

I used Azure App service for deploying spring boot project,Azure mysql for storing data generated by application,Resource mover to move resources from one group to other-I moved storage accounts for this project, application insights to view performance of Web app,used azure blob storage for storing images that are used in this Readme File.
